## Other Projects
- New fiction: this is where my energy is, but usually better to hold my tongue until it's done. Some stories ought to come out in 2022.
- Darryl Audiobook: I'm recording this myself and serializing it on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess). I tend to update on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. There are no differences between the reward tiers. I started in December 2021 and expect I will be finished by sometime in Spring 2022.
- Other writing here and there: I wrote [a short review of Holly Melgard's *Fetal Position*](https://www.artforum.com/print/202110/jackie-ess-on-holly-melgard-s-fetal-position-87249) for Artforum Best of 2021.
