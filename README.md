## Darryl
I published my first novel, [Darryl](https://bookshop.org/books/darryl/9781944866846), with [Clash Books](https://www.clashbooks.com/) in May 2021. It's the story of a guy in an unusual sex lifestyle. You might relate to him.

- You can listen to a lo-fi audiobook on [patreon, read by me](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess).
- You can also read the book [in Italian, translated by Stefano Pirone and releasted by Pidgin Edizioni.](https://www.pidgin.it/prodotto/darryl/)
- You can also find some videos of me reading sections of the book on youtube.

## In the Absolute Balloon
Short story in the Chicago Review, August 2022. You can read it online. [In the Absolute Balloon](https://www.chicagoreview.org/in-the-absolute-balloon/)

## Work in Progress
It's better to say less, but you might see something soon.
