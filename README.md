## Work in Progress
I'm working on something long. To be totally honest you won't see much of me for a while.


## In the Absolute Balloon
A new short story in the Chicago Review, August 2022. You can read it online. [In the Absolute Balloon](https://www.chicagoreview.org/in-the-absolute-balloon/)


## Darryl
I published my first novel, [Darryl](https://bookshop.org/books/darryl/9781944866846), with [Clash Books](https://www.clashbooks.com/) in May 2021. It's the story of a guy in an unusual sex lifestyle. You might relate to him.

I'm making an audiobook, pretty informally (audiophiles steer clear), and serializing it on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess). I've got 2/3 of the book down and need to sit down and do the rest. Not sure I will use the patreon for anything else, but you're welcome to throw me a few bucks if you are patient and not hurting for the money. I will finish it soon.

You can also find some videos of me reading sections of the book on youtube.

## Events
None planned for now. Stay safe.

## Contact
I seem to be back on twitter again. I'm as disappointed as anyone but having fun there. ([@jackie_ess](https://twitter.com/jackie_ess)).

Email is sometimes better. `[firstname].[lastname].writer@gmail.com` or `trip to taller windows at protonmail dot com (no spaces)`

I'd probably talk to you on the phone but I'm not posting that here.
