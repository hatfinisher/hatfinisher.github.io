## Other Projects
- **Darryl Audiobook:** I'm recording this myself and serializing it on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess). I've been very lax with this but planning a burst of recording energy soon). There are no differences between the reward tiers. I started in December 2021. I said I would finish it by Spring 2022 and you see how that's gone. But I will really finish it soon.
- **Other writing:** I'm working on something long, you won't see it for a while.

## Events
None planned for now. Stay safe.

## Contact
I seem to be back on twitter again. I'm as disappointed as anyone but having fun there. ([@jackie_ess](https://twitter.com/jackie_ess)).

Email is sometimes better. `[firstname].[lastname].writer@gmail.com` or `trip to taller windows at protonmail dot com (no spaces)`

I'd probably talk to you on the phone but I'm not posting that here.
