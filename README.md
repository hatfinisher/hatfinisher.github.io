## Darryl
I published my first novel, [Darryl](https://bookshop.org/books/darryl/9781944866846), with [Clash Books](https://www.clashbooks.com/) in May 2021. It's the story of a guy in an unusual sex lifestyle. You might relate to him.

## Other Projects
- **Darryl Audiobook:** I'm recording this myself and serializing it on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess). I tend to update on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. There are no differences between the reward tiers. I started in December 2021 and expect I will be finished by sometime in Spring 2022.
- **Other writing:** You'll see.

## Events
None planned for now. Stay safe.

## Contact
I'm *not very online* right now, but email is welcome. Avoiding social media until at least the end of 2023, accounts locked and unmonitored. I don't intend this in an antisocial way or as a disappearing act. I think some personalities are better suited to abstinence than moderation.
