This website is probably more useful to me than to you, I use it to keep track of things.

## Newsletter!
I've been experimenting with a newsletter lately, it contains a lot of my readings and some of my attempts at translation, and some essay-like thoughts. Check it out, maybe:

## Darryl
I published my first novel, [Darryl](https://bookshop.org/books/darryl/9781944866846), with [Clash Books](https://www.clashbooks.com/) in May 2021. It's the story of a guy in an unusual sex lifestyle. You might relate to him.

- You can listen to a lo-fi audiobook on [patreon, read by me](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess).
- You can also read the book [in Italian, translated by Stefano Pirone and releasted by Pidgin Edizioni.](https://www.pidgin.it/prodotto/darryl/)
- You can also find some videos of me reading sections of the book on youtube.

## Events
None planned for now. Stay safe.

## Contact
- Email: `[firstname].[lastname].writer@gmail.com` or `trip to taller windows at protonmail dot com (no spaces)`
- Phone/signal: I might like talking this way most of all but I'm not posting my number, I'm sure you understand.
- Patreon: [@jackie_ess](https://www.patreon.com/jackie_ess). I was serializing the audiobook here and now I'm not sure what to use it for. Of course you can just support me because you'd like to. I appreciate it. But I think I'll figure out something patreon-exclusive soon.
